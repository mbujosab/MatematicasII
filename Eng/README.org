#+TITLE: Teaching materials for Math II (Linear Algebra) classes

- The schedule: indicates what we will see each day in class
  
- [[./Slides_and_exercises][Slides and exercises]]: (which I will use with the classroom screen)

  - They are grouped by topic and follow the content of the [[https://github.com/mbujosab/CursoDeAlgebraLineal][book]]. You
    can find two formats: "print" (with some additional content) and
    "handout" (showing 4 slides per page).

  - (the slides are written in english, but the book is written in
    spanish. Fortunately you can find lots of Linear Algebra books
    written in english and aditional online resources [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra#External_links][here]].)

  - At the end of each lesson you can find exercises to practice the
    concepts seen in the lesson.

  - You can find past exams [[./PastExams][here]]
